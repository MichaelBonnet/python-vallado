# python-vallado
Implementation of code and algorithms from David Vallado's "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications".

Work is ongoing. I am attempting to translate from the MATLAB code to Python. This is being done fairly haphazardly, by hand.

My intended development path:

1. Directly translate every file into a matching Python file
2. Standardize opt/option stuff
3. Set up testing
4. Group into modules
5. Standardize use of numpy everywhere
